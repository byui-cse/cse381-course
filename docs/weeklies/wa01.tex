\section{Readings}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Levitin Chapter 1
\end{itemize}
\section{Preparation for Assignment}
If, and \textit{only if} you can truthfully assert the truthfulness of each statement below are you ready to start the assignment.
\subsection {Reading Comprehension Self-Check}
\begin{itemize}
	\item I know what criterion most classic algorithms satisfy.
	\item I know what systematically interrupts the narrative flow of the textbook.
	\item I know to be on the lookout for exercises versus problems, because the chapter exercises in the textbook are not marked with a difficulty level.
	\item I know where the textbook provides hints to all the exercises.
	\item I know the properties of logarithms.
	\item I know the important summation formulas.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Memory Self-Check}
\subsubsection{Determine Correct Order}

The steps for the best known algorithm for creating algorithms are listed out of order here. What order should they be in?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Decide on: computational means, exact vs approximate solving, data structure(s), algorithm
 design technique.
 	\item Design an algorithm.
	\item Understand the problem.
	\item Prove correctness of the algorithm.
	\item Analyze the algorithm.
	\item Code the algorithm.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection{Write a short answer}

Levitin states that one of these problem types is the most difficult to solve. Which is it and why is so difficult to solve?
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Sorting
	\item Searching
	\item String Processing
	\item Graph problems
	\item Combinatorial problems
	\item Geometric problems
	\item Numerical problems
\end{enumerate}
\section{Week 01 Exercises}

\subsection{Exercise 8 on page 8}
\subsection{Exercise 4 on Page 17} Write Clojure code instead of the pseudocode asked for.

\subsection{Exercise 2 on page 37}
\subsection{Exercise 9 on page 38}
 
 
\section{Week 01 Problems}
\subsection{Exercise 9 on page 25} 
\subsection{Create Three Different Algorithms to Solve this Problem}
Given two positive numbers A and B, where A is greater than B, find a way to \textit{break up} A into B unequal pieces.\\\\For example, if A = 34 and B = 4, then four unequal pieces of A are 6, 7, 9 and 12. These are unequal because there are no duplicate numbers. They break up (or sum up to) 34 because 6 + 7 + 9 + 12 = 34. The numbers representing the pieces (e.g., 6, 7, 9 and 12) must be positive integers (1, 2, 3, etc.), which excludes zero. Note that some pairs of numbers don't work, e.g., 5 and 3, so be sure to error-check that case.

\subsection{Compare/Contrast Your Three Algorithms}
In a similar manner to how Levitin compared and contrasted three different GCD algorithms, evaluate your three algorithms using three different criteria.
