\section{Preparation for Assignment}
If, and \textit{only if} you can truthfully assert the truthfulness of each statement below are you ready to start the assignment.
\subsection {Reading Comprehension Self-Check}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I know that \textit{brute force} is a straightforward approach to solving a problem, usually directly based on the problem statement and definitions of the concepts involved.
  \item I understand that a first application of the brute-force approach often
    results in an algorithm that can be improved with a modest amount of effort.
  \item I know \textit{why} it is \textbf{false} to say that a strength of the brute-force
    approach is subpar algorithmic efficiency.
  \item I understand that \textit{exhaustive search} is a brute-force approach to combinatorial problems that suggests generating each and every combinatorial object of the problem, selecting those of them that satisfy all the constraints, and then finding a desired object.
  \item I know why it is \textbf{false} to say that exhaustive search is practical for all but very small instances of problems it can be applied to.
  \item I have reviewed Appendix A specifically focusing on understanding the formulas and rules for summations.
  \item I have studied and pondered these common algorithms and understand why they have the time efficiencies they do:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Finding the maximum element in an array.
    \item Determining the uniqueness of all elements of an array.
     \item Multiplying two $n$-by-$n$ matrices.
     \item Converting a base 10 number to binary.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Memory Self-Check}

\subsubsection{Algorithm Efficiency Calculation}

Create brute force algorithms for each of these three situations:
\begin{enumerate}
     \item Computing $a^n$, where $a$ is positive and $n$ is a nonnegative integer.
     \item Computing $n!$.
     \item Sequential search.
\end{enumerate}.
Determine $\mathcal{O}$, $\Omega$, $\Theta$, input size, and time efficiency for each algorithm.
