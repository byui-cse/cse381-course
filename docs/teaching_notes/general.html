<h2>Instructor Role</h2>
<p>You will lead virtual live (remote) sessions twice each week for 1 &frac12; hours.</p>
<p>You will tutor and mentor students by joining their break-out rooms during class sessions.</p>
<p>You will have at least one office hour available each week which students can use to get help with their tasks for the week. You are expected to spend a total of 10.5 hours each week. Any unused hours in preparing presentations is to be used to contact, help, and mentor the students.</p>
<p>You will also conduct formative assessments by joining break-out rooms during class sessions, hold grade-claim meetings with each student three times during the semester, and review students' questions submitted in course channel. Each of these is described in more detail below.</p>
<h2>Student Time</h2>
<p>All your students&rsquo; tasks for each week are to be done in teams and are designed to take a team 9-12 hours/week to complete. Therefore, teams must meet outside of the class sessions to complete their tasks. You should encourage your students to begin working on their tasks prior to the second session of each week. That way they can use the supervised &frac12; hour of class time allotted for teams working on their tasks more effectively. Also encourage students to complete the hardest tasks first, if they work on the easy tasks first, they may get a false sense of how much time is needed to complete the other tasks.</p>
<h2>Weekly Pattern: Part 1</h2>
<p>Each session of each week, except the last, follows the same pattern. For each class session you will give a presentation, give the students a few simple, fun tasks to complete, assess their understanding of your presentation and, if needed, clarify, and then work with them to complete their tasks. Below you will find detailed instruction for each of the two 1&frac12; hour sessions.</p>
<p>In order to be prepared for the first weekly session, review the learning materials and student tasks for the week. Select a few, two or three, concepts from the reading that you feel are the most confusing or may be the most confusing for the students. Create a presentation for the students regarding these concepts. Also create two or three small group tasks that will help the students explore and practice applying the concepts you&rsquo;ve chosen. There is a set of these available for you to download, but you should consider these to be examples of what students have found confusing in the past, not a preselected set to be used.</p>
<h3>Session 1 Pattern</h3>
<p><strong>First &frac12; hour </strong>= Give your presentation regarding those concepts you have chosen for the week. In it, explain, in more depth, specific concepts from the reading, how you view them, and how you have used them in your career and/or life outside of computing.</p>
<p><strong>Second &frac12; hour</strong> = Whole class instruction. Either randomly assign teams or let them self-select teams to complete two small, enjoyable tasks you have defined regarding the concepts you presented. Have all the students do each task, one after the other, and after a period of time for each task, use iClicker or other Polling software to get data regarding &ldquo;How comfortable are you with your solution?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Which solution is correct?&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third &frac12; hour </strong>= In break-out rooms, each semester-long team works on the assigned weekly tasks. &nbsp;These tasks may be mathematical, may require code to be written, or both. During this time you should be jumping from one break-out room to another when you are not visiting students that have invited you to join their room to get help. This mimics the face-to-face in-class work time where instructors wander around the classroom listening in on the students working, doing formative assessment, learning who each student is, and giving help as requested. You have two roles in the break-out rooms:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gain a sense of each student&rsquo;s knowledge and skill (informal formative assessment), and</li>
<li>Provide tutoring and mentoring.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these activities help you formatively assess each student. While visiting each team, evaluate their strategy and provide tips and probative questions when they are stuck. You are part of the team. Help them brainstorm their approach to the solution but don&rsquo;t tell them what approach to follow or use.</p>
<h2>Weekly Pattern: Part 2</h2>
<p>Before midnight on the day of the first session, each student will have submitted at least one meaningful question they still have regarding the reading (you will have to encourage this behavior). Before the second session, you need to read through the questions and evaluate them as to what the underlying principles the students are missing. Do not attempt to answer each question. Aggregate them together based on the underlying principle needed. After you have done this analysis, create a presentation that includes discussion each of the principles you&rsquo;ve discovered the students don&rsquo;t yet understand. Also create two or three small, fun tasks for the students to do in class.</p>
<h3>Session 2 Pattern</h3>
<p><strong>First &frac12; hour</strong> = Instructor presentation. This is the presentation described above.</p>
<p><strong>Second &frac12; hour </strong>= Whole class instruction. Either randomly assign teams or let them self-select teams to complete two small, enjoyable tasks you have defined regarding the concepts you presented. Have all the students do each task, one after the other, and after a period of time for each task, use iClicker or other Polling software to get data regarding &ldquo;How comfortable are you with your solution?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Which solution is correct?&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Third &frac12; hour</strong> = In break-out rooms, each semester-long team works on the assigned weekly tasks.&nbsp; These tasks may be mathematical, may require code to be written, or both. During this time you should be jumping from one break-out room to another when you are not visiting students that have invited you to join their room to get help. This mimics the face-to-face in-class work time where instructors wander around the classroom</p>
<h2>Grade Claim Meetings</h2>
<p>Three times each semester, approximately every four weeks, meet with each student individually for 10 minutes. During this meeting do the following;</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the student&rsquo;s course tracker.</li>
<li>Discuss their current progress and create a plan for where they want to be at the end of the semester.
<ul>
<li>Guide students toward an accurate vision of their work by asking &ldquo;Which grade definition statement describes you?&rdquo;
<ul>
<li>The difference between a &ldquo;B&rdquo; student and an &ldquo;A&rdquo; student at quality universities world-wide is that &ldquo;B&rdquo; students have the material down, they can readily complete the tasks. For &ldquo;A&rdquo; students, the information has become part of who they are. They can then use the information outside of the specific class and can be a blessing to themselves, and others. The syllabus has a set of examples of behaviors of &ldquo;A&rdquo; students.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The BYUI and Church culture of humility sometimes precludes students from rightfully claiming their earned grade. Help students understand their worth and develop their ability to understand and describe themselves while accepting responsibility for their learning.</li>
<li>Historically, it has been rare that a student will claim a higher grade than is correct. If this is the case, tell them what you think, what you have observed of them, and why some other grade may be correct. Do not &lsquo;give&rsquo; them a grade. Ask them if your understanding is correct. Due to a perceived power differential, your students usually defer to you, so make sure they are comfortable with the grade description you have selected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss team dynamics
<ul>
<li>Ask: &ldquo;Are you meeting regularly with your team outside of class?&rdquo;</li>
<li>Make sure they are doing actual team work, not just sitting together doing individual work.</li>
<li>Students can change teams any time they want for any reason.</li>
<li>Students are responsible for joining a new team when they switch and also at the beginning of the semester.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Discuss course experience
<ul>
<li>Ask, &ldquo;To help me make the course better tell me what you what you wish you understood better?&rdquo;</li>
<li>To end the meeting on a positive note, ask &ldquo;What have you really enjoyed or understood well?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After meeting, enter the&nbsp; grade the student ultimately says is correct, their &nbsp;&ldquo;grade claim&rdquo;, in I-Learn but inform students that only the grade from the last grade claim counts towards their final grade for the course</li>
</ol>
